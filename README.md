# Global CO2 Emissions from Maven Analytics

A projeect in Tableau, I visualised Global CO2 Emissions from Maven Analytics

### Below were my findings.

The United States remains the largest emitter of CO2 overall but have made tremendous improvement in reducing their carbon footprints. 

You can see this in the C02 generated every year where there have been a over 400% reduction of carbon emission in the last decade overall.

It is also noteworthy to know that the increase in the consumption of Gas Co2 in relation to the production of cars and establishment of companies is not proportional.

This is due to more production of electric vehicles over gas motors and the diversification of power generation from C02 sources.
